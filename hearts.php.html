			<h2> <a id ="l0">Game Objective</a></h2>
			
				<p>
					To score the <em>least</em> amount of points possible.
				</p>
				
			<h2> <a id ="l1">Cards Used</a></h2>
			
				<p>
					A standard 52 card deck (Ace high)
				</p>
				
			<h2> <a id ="l2">Dealing and Passing</a></h2>
			
				<p>
					<strong>Dealing:</strong> <em>All</em> cards are dealt clockwise
				</p>
				
				<p>	
					<strong>Passing:</strong>
					Three cards are passed with each hand, except for every fourth hand.
					Select three cards to be passed, stack them facedown, and give them to the appropriate opponent. 
					You must select and pass the cards from your own hand before you can look at your new cards. 
					<ul>
						<li>First hand: Players pass three cards from their hand to the player to their left.</li>
						<li>Second hand: Players pass three cards to the player to their right.</li>
						<li>Third hand: Players pass three cards to the player sitting opposite them.</li>
						<li>Fourth hand: No cards are passed. This cycle of passes repeats until the end of the game.</li>
					</ul>
					If there are two players, alternate between first-hand and fourth-hand examples.
					If there are three players, skip the third-hand example. More than four players,
					decide how to do the third-hand example before the game begins,
					making sure you pass to each opponent before you repeat a pass.
				</p>
				
			<h2> <a id ="l3">Playing Rounds</a></h2>
			
				<p>
					<strong>Playing:</strong> The player with the lowest club must lead it to the first trick. The play continues clockwise. 
					The next player must follow suit if possible. If the suit can't be followed for the first trick, 
					any card may be played except for a heart or the Q of spades. 
					Whoever plays the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick. 
					After the first trick, a heart or the Q of spades can be "dumped" on the trick if you are out of the suit led. 
					Hearts can't be led until after a heart has been played as a discard to another trick (this is called "breaking hearts"). 
					The game continues until one player has reached or exceeded 100 points at the conclusion of a hand.
