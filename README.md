##Server status
The http://students.washington.edu/rbwatson/ server has been updated to this repo as  of 11/22/2012 @ 10:00.

##wlux_test_site
These files represent the files you would find on a website that was being studied by WebLabUX. The files in this Repo run on http://students.washington.edu/rbwatson/ .

##Test site files
* spades.html
* hearts.html
* default.css - default style used by both test pages
* test styles in the `css` directory

##Development
For testing purposes, you need to clone both wlux_test_site and
wlux_test_server into directories called `site` and `server`, respectively,
in order for everything to work properly.

Then, start up your webserver and navigate to `localhost/server/start.php` to
begin a study. Study results will be located at `localhost/server/log.txt`.
